As of April 2023, there were 2,640 known billionaires (in USD) in the world. It is helpful for researchers and governmental policymakers to understand the distribution of wealth among billionaires and its implications for economic policies, taxation, and wealth distribution. Policymakers often seek to balance the potential benefits of wealth accumulation with the need to address inequality and ensure inclusive economic growth.

Key Questions
Where are billionaires most concentrated in the world?
What factor most correlates to the number of billionaires in a country?
How are billionaires distributed according to different demographics?
Data
The “Billionaires Statistics Dataset (2023)” was acquired from Kaggle.com. The owner and compiler of the data set is Nidula Elgiriyewithana, a data scientist from Sri Lanka and a Kaggle Progression System Grand Master. The data was compiled on April 4, 2023, and uploaded to Kaggle in September 2023. The dataset was compiled from various sources, including Forbes and other financial publications. No further details on the sources were provided.

Contents: 2,640 rows, 35 columns The contents of this data set include details on each of the 2,640 billionaires listed as of April 4, 2023. There are fields for the basic demographics of each person and data on their worth in millions of US dollars (so 1,000 = 1 billion), the industries in which they made their wealth, and whether or not they are self-made. The data set also includes information on the countries in which the people live, such as the life expectancy, consumer price index, GDP, and education enrollment rates for their country.

Also acquired from Kaggle.com was the "world-countries.json" dataset containing the world mapping data for the choropleth visualizations created.
